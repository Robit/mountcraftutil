# mountcraftutil
 A commissioned utility plugin for the Spigot API that allows for entity mounting and opening crafting tables via datapack functions

**Commands:**

/mount (entity) - Mounts the executor of the command as a passenger of the entity selected. Compatible with Vanilla Entity Selectors (@a, @p[distance=..5], etc.) and /execute.

/crafting - Opens a portable crafting table for the executor of the command. Compatible with /execute.

**Permissions:** 

mountcraftutil.crafting and mountcraftutil.mount (not reccomended for general player usage. Just like vanilla, a player does not need permission to run a command if it is run through /execute as (player))

**THIS PLUGIN REQUIRES https://github.com/JorelAli/1.13-Command-API/releases IN ORDER TO FUNCTION**
